# bikesharing
mock analysis of transit information for des moines IA to determine viable implementation of bike sharing company



    
Here is the Tableau Story, first of all: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/spectralpoet/viz/challenge_16316689518480/FinalPresentation (for some reason it starts and the end and you will need to click back to see it in the intended sequence)

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze CitiBike bikesharing data from New York city with an eye to the business model's viability in Des Moines, Iowa  
  
## Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.
This is in the story. See the link.

## Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
I think it would be illuminating to see if there are duplicate trips made. The data of what time bikes are used on various days of the week seems to indicate that people are using them back and forth from work, so it would be useful to see if there are a lot of duplicate start and end location trips being made during the course of a month. A visualization would make it easy to see if these areas fall across certain zones. There may be characteristics of areas where people commute by bike more frequently that could be identified. If any similar locations could be found in test-cities they would make efficient single locations to invest small numbers of bikes to test for viability.

It would also be useful to see visualizations filtered specifically for weekend use. Data seems to indicate a distinct pattern of usage for commuting on weekdays, but leisure on weekends. Because the bikes are more frequently used during the week, and the week is longer, weekend specific data may be getting buried. It might be possible to find popular starting locations for leisure rides and identify if they are near parks or such and support those areas as pilot sites in Des Moines as well.
